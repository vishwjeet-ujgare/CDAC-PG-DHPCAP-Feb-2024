Below is the sample command to run hotspot analysis of an application with Intel VTune:

vtune --collect=hotspot --result-dir=./report -- ./mmult_serial

Write a shell script to run any executable file with Intel VTune. The shell script should:
    - load the required modules for running VTune (ask the user the name of the VTune
    module and load it using the module load command)
    - ask the user for the absolute path to the project directory (it can be any name)
    - ask the user for the absolute path to the executable file

Based on the input given by the user, the script should create and run the VTune command and generate the report.

Also, Check if the executable and project directory path exists or not on the system.

Open the generated report using the vtune-gui command.
